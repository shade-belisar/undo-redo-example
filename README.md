Example project to illustrate the problem in [this forum.bpmn.io thread](https://forum.bpmn.io/t/undo-redo-does-not-work-with-updateproperties/10088).

Prepare the project by installing all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then build the project like this:

```sh
# build the project
npm run build
```

And host the contents of the `public` folder with any web server.
